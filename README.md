Below are some insights from the EDA performed on the Fever_Medecine_Recommendation Dataset :

Univariate Analysis Insights
Numerical Variables (Histograms & Summary Statistics)

"Body_Temperature" is right-skewed, meaning some individuals have abnormally high values. This suggests that outliers may exist, or some patients have extremely high fevers.
"Age" distribution shows that most patients fall within a young to middle-aged category, with fewer elderly individuals.
"Heart_Rate" appears to be normally distributed, but with a few extreme values that might indicate underlying health conditions.
"Fever_Severity" is categorical but treated numerically, with more cases in moderate severity levels.
Categorical Variables (Count Plots)

"Gender" distribution is imbalanced, with one gender being more frequent in the dataset.
"Diet_Type" shows that certain diet types are more common, indicating that dietary habits might influence fever severity.
"Symptoms" have varying distributions, with some symptoms being significantly more frequent than others.
Outliers (Boxplots & IQR Method)

"Body_Temperature" and "Heart_Rate" contain significant outliers, which could either indicate erroneous data or critical fever conditions.
"Age" has some extreme values, but they are within expected human lifespan limits.
Multivariate Analysis Insights
Correlation Analysis (Heatmap)

"Body_Temperature" shows a moderate positive correlation with "Fever_Severity", confirming that higher temperatures are generally associated with more severe fever cases.
"Heart_Rate" has a weak positive correlation with "Fever_Severity", suggesting that higher heart rates are not the sole determinant of fever severity.
"Age" does not show a strong correlation with fever severity, meaning fever severity is not significantly age-dependent.
Categorical Relationships (Count Plots & Strip Plots)

"Gender" vs. Fever Severity: One gender has a slightly higher proportion of severe fever cases, but the difference is not drastic.
"Diet_Type" vs. Fever Severity: Some diet types are more associated with moderate to severe fever cases, which could indicate a potential link between diet and immune response.
Feature Interaction (Pairplots)

"Body_Temperature" vs. "Heart_Rate": The scatter plot indicates that as body temperature increases, heart rate slightly increases, but the relationship is not strongly linear.
"Age" vs. Fever Severity: No clear trend is observed, meaning age alone does not determine fever severity.
Boxplots for Fever Severity

"Body_Temperature" increases with higher fever severity levels, confirming it as a key predictor.
"Heart_Rate" shows overlap across severity levels, meaning it may not be a strong independent indicator of severity.
Final Observations
"Body_Temperature" is the most important factor influencing fever severity.
"Heart_Rate" has some influence but is not a sole predictor.
"Age" does not significantly impact fever severity in this dataset.
Diet and gender may have indirect effects on fever severity but require further investigation.
Some variables are highly correlated, indicating potential feature selection opportunities to improve predictive modeling.
Handling outliers in "Body_Temperature" and "Heart_Rate" is crucial for accurate modeling.
